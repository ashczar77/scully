# Scully Documentation

## Current direction

The project is exploring a safe incident-reproduction system for the Nebius x
NVIDIA Global AI Hackathon.

The system would turn a sanitized, read-only production incident bundle into a
minimal executable reproduction without giving AI production credentials or
customer data.

## Current status

- Phase: Problem and boundary validation
- Proposed next gate: P0
- Implementation: Not started
- Out-of-pocket cost limit: Zero
- Submission deadline: 30 October 2026

## Active documents

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [Hackathon project plan](HACKATHON_PROJECT_PLAN.md) | Product boundary, trust UI, architecture, delivery phases, demo, risks, and acceptance gates | Proposed |
| [Problem-first opportunity search](research/problem-first-opportunity-search.md) | Evidence and ranking that led to the current direction | Research complete |

## Immediate decision

Before implementation, Gate P0 must determine whether at least two real or
safely reconstructable incidents can be reproduced using only sanitized
evidence. If not, the concept must be narrowed or rejected.

New documentation should support the active hackathon project.
