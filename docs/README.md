# Scully Documentation

## Current direction

The project is exploring a safe incident-reproduction system for the Nebius x
NVIDIA Global AI Hackathon.

The system would turn a sanitized, read-only production incident bundle into a
minimal executable reproduction without giving AI production credentials or
customer data.

## Current status

- Phase: Problem and boundary validation
- Completed gates: G0.1 and G0.2
- Active step: Step 0.3, prove manual reproducibility
- Active gate: G0.3, reproduction viability review
- Implementation: Not started
- Out-of-pocket cost limit: Zero
- Submission deadline: 30 October 2026

## Immediate decision

Gate G0.3 must decide whether the three clean manual reproductions are
sufficient to establish viability. Approval authorizes user-value validation
and demonstration-case selection in Step 0.4.

New documentation should support the active hackathon project.
